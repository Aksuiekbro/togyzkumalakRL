## Togyz Kumalak (Togyzkumalak) — Detailed Rules

Togyz Kumalak is a traditional Kazakh sowing-and-capturing game from the Mancala family. It is also known regionally as Toguz Korgool (Kyrgyz). This document describes the commonly accepted, tournament-style rules.

### Equipment and Board Layout

- **Board**: Two rows of 9 small pits per player (total 18 small pits). Each player also has a large scoring pit called a **kazan** (cauldron) for captured stones.
- **Stones**: 162 stones in total, called **kumalak**. At the start: 9 stones in each small pit (9 × 18 = 162). Kazans begin empty.
- **Naming**:
  - Small pits: **otau** (Kazakh), sometimes called holes.
  - Scoring pits: **kazan** (one per player).
  - Special captured pit: **tuzdyk** (Kazakh; also written tuzdik/tuzduk; in Kyrgyz: tuz).

### Objective

- **Win** by collecting strictly more than half of all stones: **82 or more** in your kazan.
- If both players finish with **81** stones, the game is a **draw**.

### Setup

1. Place the board between players so each faces a row of 9 otaus.
2. Put **9 stones** into every small pit. Both kazans remain empty.
3. Decide who moves first (by lot or agreement).

### Turn Structure and Sowing

On your turn, choose one of your own non-empty pits and sow its stones counterclockwise across the small pits.

1. **Pick up stones** from the chosen pit.
2. If the chosen pit contained **more than one** stone:
   - Drop the first stone back into the starting pit, then continue sowing one stone into each subsequent pit moving counterclockwise (across both sides of the board).
3. If the chosen pit contained **exactly one** stone:
   - Do not drop it back; place that single stone into the **next** pit counterclockwise.
4. Continue sowing one-by-one through small pits only. You **never** drop stones into either kazan during sowing.

Notes:
- Sowing passes from your side to your opponent’s side and back, looping around as needed.
- You may not select an empty pit.

### Capturing by Even Number

After sowing completes, check the pit where the **last** stone was dropped:

- If the last stone landed in an **opponent’s** pit and that pit now holds an **even** number of stones, you immediately capture all stones from that pit and place them into your **kazan**. The opponent’s pit becomes empty.
- If the last stone landed in **your own** pit, or if the opponent’s pit is odd after the drop (and not exactly three, see Tuzdyk), no even capture occurs.

### Creating a Tuzdyk (Special Pit)

A tuzdyk is a special opponent-side pit that automatically yields its stones to its owner.

You create a tuzdyk if and only if, after your last sown stone lands in an **opponent’s** pit, that pit’s count becomes **exactly three (3)** and all restrictions below are satisfied.

When a tuzdyk is created:
- The **three stones** in that pit are immediately captured into your **kazan**.
- The pit is marked as **your tuzdyk**. From now on, any stones that land in that pit (during either player’s sowing) are immediately moved to **your kazan** instead of remaining in the pit.

Restrictions:
- Each player may create **at most one** tuzdyk in a game.
- You **cannot** create a tuzdyk in your opponent’s **ninth** pit (their rightmost pit).
- You **cannot** create a tuzdyk in a pit that is **symmetrical** to your opponent’s existing tuzdyk (i.e., the same pit index on the opposite side).

Important clarifications:
- If your move would otherwise create a second tuzdyk for you, or create one in the opponent’s ninth pit, or create one symmetrical to the opponent’s tuzdyk, the move itself is still **legal**, but **no new tuzdyk** is formed. Standard even capture may still apply if conditions are met.
- When sowing, if a stone is dropped into **any existing tuzdyk**, that stone is transferred immediately to the owner’s **kazan**; it does not remain on the board.

### End of the Game

The game ends in either of these cases:

1. **Atsyz kalu** (left without a horse): At the start of a player’s turn, all of their pits are empty. The opponent immediately collects **all remaining stones on the board** into their kazan. Tally scores to determine the result.
2. A player has already secured **82 or more** stones in their kazan; the game is decided (in practice, play may stop once the outcome is mathematically certain).

Result:
- **82+ stones** in your kazan: you **win**.
- **81–81**: **draw**.

### Numbering and Direction (Common Conventions)

- Pits are often numbered **1–9 from a player’s right to left**. Direction of sowing is **counterclockwise** around the board.
- In written notations and software, letters (a–i / A–I) or numbers may be used; conventions vary by source.

### Edge Cases and Examples

- If your last stone lands in your own pit, you **cannot** capture by even number and you **cannot** create a tuzdyk (tuzdyk can only be created on the opponent’s side).
- If your last stone lands in an opponent’s pit and brings its count to an **even** number (other than three), you capture all stones from that pit (place into your kazan), and the pit becomes empty.
- If your last stone lands in an opponent’s pit and brings its count to **three**, you create a tuzdyk there (subject to restrictions), and the three stones are immediately captured to your kazan.
- Stones that fall into **any tuzdyk** during sowing are immediately removed to the tuzdyk owner’s kazan (they do not stay on the board).

### Quick Glossary

- **Kumalak**: Stone (seed, ball) used as a playing piece.
- **Otau**: Small pit on the board; each player has nine.
- **Kazan**: Player’s scoring pit where captured stones are stored.
- **Tuzdyk**: Special opponent-side pit that, once created, automatically yields stones to its owner.

### Official Tournament Rules (Chapter I)

The following section reformats the official Chapter I rules text for clarity while preserving its meaning and numbering.

#### 1.1. The nature and objectives of Togyzkumalak game

1) The game is played between two opponents who move their "kumalaks" alternately on a special board called the **Orda board** (of togyzkumalak). The player playing with **white** makes the first move. A player is said to "have the move" when the opponent has completed their move.

2) The objective of each player is to win, either by:
   - capturing into their **kazan** more than **81** kumalaks as soon as possible; or
   - reaching a position where the opponent has **no kumalaks** on their side of the Orda board and the number of kumalaks in the opponent’s kazan is **less than 81**.

3) If both players have captured **81** kumalaks each, the game is **drawn**.

#### 1.2. The initial position

1) The Orda board is divided symmetrically into two equal sides and is composed of **18 longitudinal** and **2 cross** "otau" (sections). Each side of the Orda board comprises **9 otau** and **1 kazan** (for storing captured kumalaks). Numbering of otau on each side goes from **left to right counterclockwise (1 to 9)**. Traditional names of the otau are:

   1 – art, 2 – tekturmas, 3 – at otpes, 4 – at suratar, 5 – bel, 6 – belbasar, 7 – kandykakpan, 8 – kokmoin, 9 – mandai.

   Each player’s **kazan** is located on the **opponent’s side** of the Orda board.

2) A printed image of the Orda board is called a **diagram**. On diagrams, the bottom row (numerals 1–9) denotes **White’s** otau; the upper row denotes **Black’s** otau. At the beginning, each player has **81** kumalaks: **9** in each otau. Initial position (schematic):

```
Kazan of the Black

 9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1
 9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9   ← Black pits
 9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9  9   ← White pits
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

Kazan of the White
```

#### 1.3. The move

1) A move consists of taking all kumalaks from any one of your otau and sowing them **from left to right**, beginning with the chosen otau, dropping **one kumalak per otau** without skipping any. After your 9th otau, continue at the opponent’s 1st otau, then their 2nd, and so on. Players move **alternately**.

2) You may move from an otau containing **one** kumalak. In this case, the kumalak is placed into the **next** otau counterclockwise, and the original otau becomes **empty**.

3) If the last kumalak lands in an **opponent’s** otau and the number of kumalaks in that otau becomes **even**, this is a **winning capture** for the move: all kumalaks from that otau are moved to the player’s **kazan**. If the last kumalak lands in an opponent’s otau and the number becomes **odd**, no capture is made.

4) Each move must be made with **one hand only**, except when moving from a very large otau (called **bai**) where kumalaks cannot be gathered into one hand.

5) A move is considered **completed** when the player has placed the last kumalak into an otau (or kumalaks into the kazan), stopped their own clock, and started the opponent’s clock.

6) Provided the player first expresses intent (e.g., "I adjust"), the player to move may adjust one or more kumalaks in their otau. If the player deliberately **touches** kumalaks in an otau, they must move from the **first otau touched**.

#### 1.4. The Tuzdyk

1) If during a move the last kumalak lands in an opponent’s otau containing **2** kumalaks (excluding otau **#9**), the moving player **must declare** their **tuzdyk** on that otau. The **3** kumalaks are immediately captured to the mover’s **kazan**.

2) The otau where the tuzdyk is taken must be **specially marked**. Thereafter, all kumalaks that fall into this otau are transferred to the **kazan** of the player who declared the tuzdyk.

3) Each player may take a tuzdyk **only once** in a game. A player **cannot** take a tuzdyk from an otau whose number **corresponds** to the opponent’s already-taken tuzdyk (i.e., the **symmetrical** otau). A tuzdyk **cannot** be taken from otau **#9**.

#### 1.5. The completed game

1) The game is completed when one player has captured **more than 81** kumalaks.

2) The game is **won** by a player whose opponent **resigns**; this immediately ends the game.

3) In other cases, play continues until one player has **no kumalaks** on their side of the board — this situation is called **atsyrau** (no legal move). At that moment, only kumalaks already captured into each player’s **kazan** are counted:
   - fewer than **81**: loss;
   - exactly **81**: draw;
   - more than **81**: win.

4) The game is **drawn** if both players have captured **81** kumalaks each.

5) The game **may be drawn** if an **identical position** occurs at least **three times** and one player claims a draw.

6) The game is **drawn by agreement** between the players; this immediately ends the game.

7) Scoring: win (or win by forfeit) = **1** point; loss (or forfeit) = **0** points; draw = **1/2** point. If a game is not played (opponent absent), the winner is recorded with a **(+)** sign (counts as 1 point) and the opponent with a **(–)** sign (0 points). The **(+/–)** administrative results do not count toward awarding qualification.
